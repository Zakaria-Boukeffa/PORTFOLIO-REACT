# Portfolio React

This project is a personal portfolio website, built as a hands-on exercise while following an online React course.

Developed using *React* in a *Node.js* environment (via Next.js), the portfolio features a clean and modern layout including:

- An inspiring *Hero section* :3  
- Standard sections like *About*, *Projects*, *Experience*, *Education*, *Skills*, and *Contact*

The goal was to put React concepts into practice while crafting a functional and visually appealing developer portfolio.  
It is fully responsive across devices.

**Tech Stack**: React • CSS • Next.js  
**Deployed with**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)  
**Live preview**: [zakaria-boukeffa.vercel.app](https://zakaria-boukeffa.vercel.app/)

### Future Improvements

- Implement **Tailwind CSS** instead of raw CSS
- Improve the **mobile version** scroll and layout behavior (currently initialized but not as smooth as desktop)
