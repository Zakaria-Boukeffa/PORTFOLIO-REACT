        <p>
          Hi there, I’m Zakaria BOUKEFFA, a Computer Science student with a deep enthusiasm for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I approach problems with a critical mindset, focusing on breaking down complex issues into manageable parts and finding practical, innovative, and effective solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I’m focused on data-related topics and deep learning, but I also work on app development from time to time.
